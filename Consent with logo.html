<i>This consent form, a copy of which can be saved or printed out for your records and reference, and is only part of the process of informed consent. It should give you the basic idea of what the research is about and what your participation will involve. If you would like more detail about something mentioned here, or information not included here, you should ask. Please take the time to read this carefully and to understand any accompanying information. </i><br/><br/>

<b>Purpose</b>: This experiment examines implicit and explicit learning in psychological distress. <br/><br/>

<b>Procedure</b>:  You will complete a short mental health questionnaire. Later, you will study and then be asked to answer questions about series of items. All information will be presented on a computer screen. You will be asked to provide your answers by mouse clicks and keystrokes on a computer keyboard. The experiment will take no longer than 30 minutes to complete.<br/><br/>

<b>Risks and benefits</b>:
 There are typically no risks involved, greater than that which you might experience in the normal conduct of your everyday. However, some participants may find disclosing information about their mental health distressing. For this reason, we have supplied a list of free mental health resources at the end of the study. If you experience any distress, you should contact one of these resources. You will benefit from participating by gaining experience with scientific research in psychology.<br/><br/>

<b>Your privacy</b>: Digital data files will be kept indefinitely on a password protected server "pavlovia" and password protected computer. If you wish to keep a copy of this consent form, then you are free to print it or email <i>martsyns@myumanitoba.ca</i> (the email will be provided again at the end of the experiment).
<br/><br/>

<b>Compensation</b>:  You will receive 1 credit toward your final grade in Introductory Psychology (Psychology 1200). <br/><br/>

<b>Voluntary withdrawal</b>: Even after you consent to participate in the experiment, you can choose to withdraw your participation at any time and with no consequence by closing a web browser or pressing the "Esc" button on the keyboard. You can withdraw the experiment, even after completion of one task. Once you finished completing the experiment, you will not be able to withdraw. If you withdraw from the experiment, your data will be deleted. You will still get credit if you choose to withdraw from the study. </b></i><br/><br/>

<b>Feedback</b>: Following the experiment, there will be a debrief page that will inform you of the experiment's aims, and the expected results. If you are interested in learning the outcome of this specific experiment, please leave us with your email address in the space provided at the end of the experiment. We will send you a description as soon as possible, but no later than May 2021. Your email addresses will not be linked to your responses in any way.
<br/><br/>

<b>Dissemination</b>: The results of the study will be presented in thesis, presentations, academic conferences, and publication.<br/><br/>

<b>Consent:</b> If you wish to participate in the experiment please click the button "I agree" to begin the study. This constitutes signing the consent form. <br/><br/>
